		<h1>How Earth Affects Weather in Different Ways</h1>
		<h2>Introduction to Weather</h2>
	
		<img src="" alt="">
		<p>
			Earths tilt and heating affect weather in many ways. Even some of the smallest  things can have the biggest impact on our weather. Today I am going to show you how Earth's uneven heating affects our weather and how its tilt and spin also affect it. I hope you enjoy this presentation because it took a lot of time to make even though it looks very basic.

		<h2>Uneven Heating</h2>
		<p>
			When the Earth is heated by the sun, it gets heated at an angle,  which causes air pressure. Since the middle of  Earth is constantly heated, the air there begins to heat up and rise into the air. With the heating of air, this creates a low pressure area which draws other air in, creating wind. This heating and cooling turns into a convection current, which in turn causes different types of weather.s

		<h2>Earth's Spin/Tilt</h2>
		<p>
			With Earth’s tilt, the weather is affected because the sun is hitting us at an angle and that causes the four seasons, giving us our main source of weather. The spin of Earth however causes jet streams and weather patterns such as the Trade Winds. These winds can end up causing rain, snow, and other types of precipitation. The wind patterns combined with Earth’s tilt is what gives us our specific types of weather. The angle at which the sun hits the earth changes the heating of the Earth, causing the Earth’s uneven heating.</p>
