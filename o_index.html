	HTML CODING
	<h1>
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) coding has been used for many things, from creating a basic website like mine, to creating something as complex and sophisticated as google or Wikipedia. Today, I am going to talk about HTML and what it is. Hopefully your questions will be answered by the end of this essay.

HTML coding can function by itself, creating some of the basic websites pages, even Google! However, it will work a lot better if you combine it with multiple different codes. Html is popular because it is multi-functional and can be combined with a variety of different codes, from CSS(Cascading Styles Sheet) to bootstrap. It also uses Javascript, and CSS and Java are both codes which are commonly used. Since HTML  coding is so flexible, many web developers choose to use it as their main code. Many engineers benefit greatly from learning to code.

	Learning to use HTML requires a significant amount of patience and room for errors. There are over 30,000 different ways to manipulate HTML, and each part is unique in its own way. For example, take marquee. There are at least 70 different types of marquees alone. Below is an example of a marquee, an image tag, a heading, and a checkbox link. If you want to see a contact example, check out my contact page. Now, back to the topic. HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 (computerhope.org) and was originally called HyperText Markup language. HTML quickly became one of the most popular languages, and by 1994 it had already begun to be used worldwide.

	HTML coding has evolved from being a mere thought in someone's mind to the largest type of coding ever used. Below are some examples of HTML coding.
