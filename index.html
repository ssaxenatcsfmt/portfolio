			Your goal is to get to the gold (yellow) at the end of an abandoned mineshaft and then get back to the surface. To do that,
			you will need to grab tnt (red), and then place it where red appears (the options for tnt). You will need to grab tnt
			3 times. You will also need to climb up and down roaps (tan). Watch out for rotten planks and magma! Be warned, once you
			get the gold, all the lights will switch out!
