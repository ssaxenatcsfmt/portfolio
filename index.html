<h1>How Earth Affects Weather in Different Ways</h1>

		<h2>Introduction to Weather</h2>

	

		

		<p>
	
			Earths tilt and heating affect weather in many ways. Even some of the smallest  things can have the biggest impact on our weather. Today I am going to show you how Earth's uneven heating affects our weather and how its tilt and spin also affect it. I hope you enjoy this presentation because it took a lot of time to make even though it looks very basic.

		<h2>Uneven Heating</h2>

		<p>

			When the Earth is heated by the sun, it gets heated at an angle,  which causes air pressure. Since the middle of  Earth is constantly heated, the air there begins to heat up and rise into the air. With the heating of air, this creates a low pressure area which draws other air in, creating wind. This heating and cooling turns into a convection current, which in turn causes different types of weathers.

		<h2>Earth's Spin/Tilt</h2>

		<p>

			With Earth’s tilt, the weather is affected because the sun is hitting us at an angle and that causes the four seasons, giving us our main source of weather. The spin of Earth however causes jet streams and weather patterns such as the Trade Winds. These winds can end up causing rain, snow, and other types of precipitation. The wind patterns combined with Earth’s tilt is what gives us our specific types of weather. The angle at which the sun hits the earth changes the heating of the Earth, causing the Earth’s uneven heating.

			<h2>Model Example</h2>

			<p>

			Lets say you take a paper plate and start spning it on a flat surface. Then you get another person to slowly draw a straight line from the middle of the plate to the edge. This line will come out crooked. This would represent how Earth's spin would effecrt weather. The tilt is slightly different. You can take a balloon and heat it up with a lamp, but tilt the balloon 23 degrees to the left. After doing this, wait a 5 minutes and then feel the side where the lamp's heat has been hitting the balloon. It should be hot. Then you should feel the air arund it, which should feel weird. This air is the low pressur area built up by the balloon's heat.
